        <tr><td><strong>Desc:</strong> <p>Once again, author Tilly Bagshawe takes up the mantle of the late, great Sidney Sheldon and again, she succeeds magnificently. Written in the inimitable Sheldon style and based on extensive, never before published material from his private archives, Sidney Sheldons Angel of the Dark is a thrilling tale of murder, lies, and lust that the master storyteller the bestselling author of Master of the Game, The Other Side of Midnight, and so many other beloved classicswould have been proud to have called his own. With Sidney Sheldons Angel of the Dark, a gripping, stylish, sexy and surprising story of a sons globe-hopping hunt for answers about his wealthy fathers brutal death, confirmed Sheldon fans have good reason to rejoice. The legacy truly lives on.<br />
LAPD Detective Danny McGuire could never forget the face of Angela Jakes and the nightmare she enduredraped, beaten, and tied to the murdered body of her elderly husband, multimillionaire art dealer Andrew. His obsession nearly cost McGuire his sanity, even after the stunning young widow disappeared without a trace. Ten years later, living in France and working for Interpol, he's put the past behind him . . . until Matt Daley, Andrew Jakes's estranged son, walks into his life. <br />
Digging into his father's still-unsolved murder, Matt has uncovered three identical slayings, and soon he is joining forces with Danny to pursue a brilliant, elusive killer across the globe. But in Hong Kong everything starts to crumble as Matt is irresistibly drawn to the most recent widow, beautiful Lisa Baring, whom Danny suspects may be someone far more sinister than just another victim . . . <br />
